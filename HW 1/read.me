# Homework 1

This folder contains the solutions and submissions for Homework 1 of the EECE 7205: Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course at Northeastern University.

## Submission Instructions:
- Submit one single PDF file for this homework, including both coding problems and analysis problems.
- For coding problems, copy and paste your codes and report your results.
- For analysis problems, either type or hand-write and scan.

## Contents:
1. **Question 1:** Coding problems involving insertion sort and mergesort algorithms. Determine the input size where mergesort begins to outperform insertion sort in terms of worst-case running time.
2. **Question 2:** Demonstration of array arrangement during each iteration of insertion sort and quicksort's Partition subroutine for a given array.
3. **Question 3:** True or False statements related to asymptotic notation (Big O, Omega, Theta).
4. **Question 4:** Application of the master method to determine the time complexity of given recurrence relations.
5. **Question 5:** Extra credit question involving drawing a recursion tree for a given recurrence relation and proving the obtained time complexity using the substitution method.

Please refer to the respective folders for solutions and submissions for subsequent homework assignments.
